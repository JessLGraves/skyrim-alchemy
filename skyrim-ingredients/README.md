# README

## Intro

This is a repository holding code base for an Elder Scrolls V: Skryim alchemy app.

The purpose of this app is to allow users to easily search known ingredients, their effects, find other ingredients that share effects and build potions/poisons.

This app was born out of my own personal frustration trying to navigate the items in my inventory and finding what potions were available to concoct.

## Data source

Ingredient data and their effects are taken from [elderscrolls.fandom.com](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Created_Potions_(Skyrim)). Script to scrape data from their potions page provided in this repo (`api-download-data.R`).

Effect descriptions taken from [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alchemy_Effects#Effect_List) alchemy effects.
